LiveSplit.Amnesia
=================

This is a [LiveSplit] component for Amnesia: The Dark Descent.
Originally created by [Fatalis](https://github.com/fatalis).
When Amnesia updated the load remover stopped working, so I changed the memory addresses to make it compatible with the new update.

Features
--------

  * Removes load times.

Requirements
------------

  * Amnesia: The Dark Descent - Steam
  * LiveSplit 1.6+
  * .NET Framework 4

  * Type "Amnesia: The Dark Descent" in LiveSplit's Splits Editor and click Activate. You don't have to download anything manually.
